# AIALA infrastructure

This repo provides a Terraform script to deploy AIALA necessary infrasctructure resources in Azure.

## Deployed resources

Running the Terraform script will deploy the resources below in your Azure subscription:
- [x] 1 resource group
- [x] 1 SQL Server
- [x] 2 SQL Databases
- [x] 1 Storage account
- [x] 1 App Service Plan
- [x] 3 App Services  
- [x] 1 App Insights
- [x] 1 Computer Vision API
- [x] 1 Azure Maps API

The [monthly estimated cost](https://azure.com/e/e027e7c1ecb149fb94c336fef32c369b) for the overall solution at *low use* is **$20**.

## Terraform requirements:
- An [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) subscription
- Terraform configured with access to Azure
    1. Download [Terraform distribution package](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
    2. Unzip the binary called `terraform`
    3. Update your path to add the path to the Terraform binary
- An Azure service principal 
```
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}"
```
- Update your environment variables with your subscription ID, client ID, client secret and tenant ID
``` 
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=xxxxxxxx
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxx
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxx
export ARM_TENANT_ID=xxxxxxxx 
```
- Verify the installation by executing the `terraform` command in your console. If terraform can't be found, please check your Path environment variable set-up

## Getting started

Update the default variables defined in [variables.tf](./terraform/variables.tf). The storage name has to be unique, that is why an id has to be add to the original name. 

Run the `terraform init` command to fetch the Azure provider's configuration and set-up the Azure storage backend.

Check which Terraform will perform before applying the script by running `terraform plan`.

Apply your plan with : `terraform apply`

You can check in Azure if your resources where correctly deployed. For the next step, get the correct configuration values for the web application and mobile application variables.
